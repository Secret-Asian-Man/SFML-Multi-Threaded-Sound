CANNOT have .mp3 files. licensing is too expensive.
Reccommended to use .wav files.

Name your sound files the following:

Automode.wav
Initialized.wav
ReadyClaw.wav
Transform.wav
GoHome.wav
Rotate.wav
SkidSteer.wav
PickUp.wav
GetBlock.wav
GotBlock.wav
GiveUp.wav
DropOff.wav



If you need to add or remove sound files, you will have to call addSound() from the SoundClass class.
